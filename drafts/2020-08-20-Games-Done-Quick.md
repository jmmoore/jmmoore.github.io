For the last ten years, twice a year, a bunch of gamers have gotten together in a hotel ballroom to celebrate playing video games in ways that their developers never intended: as quickly as possible, with no regard for the story, level boundaries, or in some cases, the limits of human ability.

### Games Done Quick

I am of course writing about the speedrunning marathons collectively known as [Games Done Quick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Games_Done_Quick): Awesome Games Done Quick typically takes place on the first week of January, and Summer Games Done Quick is in mid-August (not coincidentally ongoing right now). 

A speedrun is a way to play a video game as quickly as possible. If you can think of a video game, someone has almost certainly done a speedrun of it. Runs come in all sorts of categories. The most common one is "any percent", shortened to any%. This means that a valid run 
The marathons run 24 hours a day, for a week. Speedrunners submit their run suggestions to the organizers, who choose runs based on their novelty or filling specific blocks of time. 

Not only are the marathons a cool spectacle and an opportunity for a niche community of gamers to get together, they raise money for charity (AGDQ raises money for the [Prevent Cancer Foundation](https://www.preventcancer.org/), SGDQ for [Doctors Without Borders](https://www.msf.org/)).

This year, due to the global pandemic, the marathon is entirely online. As of this writing, viewers of the chat have donated over $700,000. They donate to various incentives, like what names to give the characters in an RPG, as well as incentives to unlock extra runs, more difficult runs, and the chance to win actual things. Artists contribute paintings, props, and books to a raffle-style contest.
