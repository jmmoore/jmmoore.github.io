I'm Jacob.

* I'm a fraternal twin.
* I'm a graduate of Seth Godin's altMBA (Udon gang! :ramen:)

Some things about this site:

* It uses the Lanyon theme of [Poole](https://getpoole.com/), a pre-made template for Jekyll static sites.
* It's developed on GitHub and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).
* I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to manage the pages and the GitHub repo.

If you want to chat, send me a message at <jacob@moorejm.com>.

I do use social media, but only check it sporadically. Email is by far the easiest way to reach me.

Thanks for reading!
