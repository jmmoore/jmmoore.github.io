When I finish a book, I put it in a stack on top of my bookcases, and refuse to properly shelve it until I can annotate it for my commonplace book and write a short review.

I've assembled quite a backlog since August, when I last wrote one of these. 

### *A Memory Called Empire* by Arkady Martine

A few times a year, a book (usually a novel) grabs me by the collar and forces me to engage with it. *A Memory Called Empire* was this kind of novel.

In 2020, I've discovered and fully embraced my love of mysteries. The pursuit of the unknown and understanding how a plan comes together are elements that I have found irresistable. 

*Memory* combines a mystery with a fish-out-of-water story in a crumbling empire. Some of the names took a bit to adjust to, which complements the themes of immigration, cultural assimilation, and seeking understanding despite difference. 

A galactic empire past its peak and struggling to maintain its frontier is a great setting, whether it's Rome or the Ottomans or the contemporary United States. Highly recommended.

### *Hear The Wind Sing* and *Pinball 1973* by Haruki Murakami

These are Murakami's first two novels, published together in a single double-sided volume. When you finish one of the books, you flip it over to read the other half. I liked this gimmick. The novels themselves are coming-of-age stories that are mostly unremarkable. Murakami himself was aware of this, and thus didn't translate them to English for years after their publication in Japan.

*Pinball* is the better of the two stories, about the pursuit of nostalgia, trying to recapture the transcendence of a past achievement and what happens when you actually find it. Recommended for Murakami diehards but others can give it a pass.

### *What I Talk About When I Talk About Running* by Haruki Murakami

This is the third time through *Running* for me. Every time, this book has had a powerful impact on me. Not quite powerful enough to get me to *actually start running* but that's neither here nor there.

Murakami connects his running practice to his writing practice, and expounds upon the connection to the rest of his life and to his career. Of particular note is the concept of *the void*, a flow-like state that Murakami attains during a run, a place where thoughts fall away and the only thing that exists is the next step. The end of the book discusses his competitive nature and grappling with being past his perceived peak as a runner.

I understand why this book might not land with some people. Those expecting a running book get a memoir, those who are looking for a book about writing get all this running junk. For me, it's an examination of the integration of physical practice and creative practice, how discipline can reinforce discipline. I loved it.

### *Steal Like an Artist* by Austin Kleon

*Steal Like an Artist* is a kick in the pants creatively. It's brief, urgent, and vital. I return to it often for inspiration and a reminder of what being on fire feels like. Austin exhorts us to find common threads between our different inspirations, to mix and match and try their styles on for ourselves. The section that struck me most was about switching between physical and analog. Write longhand, edit on a computer, that sort of thing.

If you're in Wichita reading this, I have an unmarked copy that you are welcome to. First come, first served.

### *Extreme Ownership* by Jocko Willink and Leif Babin

I read this for the first time last year, but reread it with a company book club. On reread, I found that I liked it significantly less than the first time. The military anecdotes didn't land with me at all, even when the business advice did. If you love SEALs and stories about solving problems in the battlefield mixed in with your professional development, this is fully in your wheelhouse. Otherwise, an easy pass.

### *Turning Pro* by Steven Pressfield

A sequel to the irreplacable *The War of Art*. The first book is a polemic against The Resistance, an exploration of how it manifests and what it *feels like* to be a professional. *Turning Pro* is a more practical guide to the day-to-day fight against stagnation and creative death. 

It examines the life of the amateur, how we sabotage ourselves in subtle ways, and closes with the mindset of the professional. A good companion with *Steal Like an Artist*, it is another signpost to the creative practice that will help us all, whether we're writers or artists or professional IT people.

### *The Three-Body Problem* by Cixin Liu

After hearing rave reviews about this book from multiple people I trust, I dove in. This is *hard* sci-fi, featuring diversions about fluid dynamics, the velocities of bodies in three-dimensional space, and Chinese revolutionary politics.

I found myself skimming when it got above my level of scientific understanding. This didn't meaningfully detract from the plot of the novel, in my view. Liu's true triumph here is the depiction of the responses to the overwhelming external power trying to exert its influence on the human race. There is no clean divide, and even within the two major camps that form, there are splinter factions.

The main character's wife and child might as well not exist after the first hundred pages, and that's a shame. This is the biggest complaint about the novel; the main character is a cipher with little personality of his own. I found myself not caring about his opinions in favor of the story he was an inextricable part of. This is a series; I'm unsure if I'll keep with it.

### *The Silent Patient* by Alex Michaelides

I'm bookending this set of reviews with tremendous debut novels. Unlike *A Memory Called Empire*, *The Silent Patient* is a grounded in reality, to a chilling degree. A gripping horror mystery about a therapist's obsession with understanding a mute widow who, when credibly charged with his murder, was committed to an institution rather than incarcerated.

As the protagonist blurs the lines of good practice and good taste in pursuit of helping his patient, he reveals the depths of his own trauma. It plays the "therapists are all seeking their own cure" cliche to its hilt, and the conclusion is perfect and satisfying.
