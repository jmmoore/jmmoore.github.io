### Why Not Both?

In [my last post](<{{ site.url }}/posts/2017-06-21-on-unemployment-malaise.html>), I said the following:

>The dream is to [make a living] with words, through writing or speaking or teaching. <br/>However, my resume and experience indicate a person with Development and DevOps skills.

The truth of the matter is that writing is a valuable skill to have in life generally. There's no reason that one cannot be and do both.

Here are just some of the things that a developer can write:

* Technical Blog Posts
  * Failure Post-Mortems
  * Success Post-Mortems
  * Tips and Tricks
  * Tutorials
* Patch Notes
* Documentation
* Tech Talks
* Reviews
  * Conference Overview
  * Software Review

This doesn't even cover personal writing, like a book or game review, or a general opinion piece.

Like most of my writing, this is as much a message to myself as it is to anyone reading it:

>Take some time every day to express yourself with words. It's easier and more valuable than you think.
