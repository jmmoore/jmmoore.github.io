### [It's alright not to feel okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTLbR80pIqY)

It's been almost seven weeks since I've worked for pay. 

I haven't been out of work for this long at any point in my employment history. The experience been alternately freeing and frustrating, in a number of different ways.

Freeing in that:

- I don't have to worry about company or interpersonal politics.
- I don't have to work on uninspiring projects.
- I don't have to work with uninspiring people.
- If I want to take a break in the middle of the day for a couple hours, I can.
- I can wear pajamas all day.
- I don't have to really worry about a team lead or manager breathing down my neck.
- I can wake up naturally.
- I get to set my own schedule.

Frustrating in that:

- I get to set my own schedule, which consumes a lot of energy.
- No one is expecting anything of me. All of the standards I have are self-imposed.
- I am not generating income.
- I have to rely on the state unemployment system.
- Every expenditure must be scrutinized more closely than ever.
- Being social is difficult as finding free things to do is not always easy.
- Dating is difficult for a number of reasons, not the least of which is having money to go on dates.
- A lot of uncertainty is added to every day.
- A lot of work is involved in trying to find work.

### The Slump

Over the last week or so, a kind of ennui has set in. It began on Saturday after having breakfast with D. I journaled for a while, and then sat down and played video games for the rest of the day. Repeat for Sunday, except with some cooking and socializing with parents. By Monday morning, during which I had a minor financial crisis, I had reached peak Can't Even.

The few responses I've gotten in terms of work have been uninspiring and disheartening. This among other things has led to a reclusive and depressing headspace.

I'm also still struggling with how exactly I wish to earn a living. The dream is to do so with words, through writing or speaking or teaching. However, my resume and experience indicate a person with Development and DevOps skills. This kind of work is far more in demand, generally pays better and has more stability.

### Help is Within Reach

On Tuesday, I reached out to my support network. They helped me expand on some ideas and provided some valuable advice regarding my malaise. Advice that I had read and heard before, but as Samuel Johnson said, 
> "People need to be reminded more often than they need to be instructed." 

They reminded me of simple but not easy things like:

* Set a few small, achievable daily goals.
* Write a rough schedule for your day.
* Get some exercise.
* Remember to eat.

### Overcoming the Slump

My current strategy is to pursue DevOps/Developer work while continuing to write every day. Doing work and gaining experience in this field will provide a lot of grist for the personal writing mill, not to mention a lot of opportunities to write in other capacities. Technical manuals and documentation don't write themselves.

Going forward in this space you'll see progress on this front. Writing about:

* Falling back in love with code
* Provisioning a Development Environment with Ansible
* Minimal, simple websites with HTML5
* Writing JavaScript with Kotlin
* Creating and linking databases with SQLite
* Lessons learned from books and video games

I hope that you'll come along with me.
